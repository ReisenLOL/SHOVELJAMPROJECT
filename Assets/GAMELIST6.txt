wow. i haven't talked in a bit.
okay.
so
literally every system is done. i think. i'm not sure.
i'm basically just stalling to get content done by adding stuff like a main menu and a pause menu lol
lets see...
+ placement
+ unit ai
+ flux systems. all of them.
+ world gen
+ ok this is stupid lets just figure out what's next

- actual sprites. this is drawing and you're LAZY sylvia.
- more buildings
    = ideas: repulsion field that knocks back enemies, fabricator and distributor, literal mine, smaller turret
x more enemies (mostly done?)
- wave design
- balancing
x make placement of pipes better (placeholder funny idk how to fix lol)
