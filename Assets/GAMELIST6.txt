wow. i haven't talked in a bit.
okay.
so
literally every system is done. i think. i'm not sure.
i'm basically just stalling to get content done by adding stuff like a main menu and a pause menu lol
lets see...
+ placement
+ unit ai
+ flux systems. all of them.
+ world gen
+ ok this is stupid lets just figure out what's next

- actual sprites. this is drawing and you're LAZY sylvia.
- more buildings
    = ideas: repulsion field that knocks back enemies, fabricator and distributor, literal mine, smaller turret
x more enemies (mostly done?)
- wave design
- balancing
x make placement of pipes better (placeholder funny idk how to fix lol)

okay final to do list 
x make a sprite for fabricator, xdistributor, xrepulsion field, xwalls, xrocket turret, xall 3 flux tank sizes, xflux condenser generator
x get a name for the game. it's still touhou themed so whatever i can figure out for flux and touhou. Touhou Flux Conduit Path
/ design waves, and either a bossfight at the end or make it endless. endless is easier. we will make it endless.
- balance game (waves, all buildings)
x make the main menu more pretty. currently just Play, Options, Credits, Exit button ontop of a frame.
- optionally add some ingame music, functionalize the options menu to set the music
- create an ingame tutorial, no need to make it complex just pages of images and arrows and text.
- fix any bug you find.
- create the itch.io page, make it cool
